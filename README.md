# PharmacyManagement
C++

John is the administrator of the “Smiles” Pharmacy. He needs a software
application to help him manage his pharmacy's medication stocks. Each
Medication is stored in the following way: name, type, quantity. 

John wants his new application to help him in the following ways:

a. He wants to be able to add, delete or update a medication. A
medicine is uniquely identified by its id. If a product
that already exists is added, its quantity will be modified (the new quantity is
added to the existing one).

b. He wants to be able to see all the available medications containing a given string (if the string is
empty, all the available medications will be considered), sorted by ascending medication name
and quantity.

c. He wants to be able to see only those medications that are in short supply (quantity less than X
items, where the value of X is provided by John).

d. The application must provide the option to undo the last change.
